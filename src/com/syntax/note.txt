Why we don't use our local/personal laptops/computers to host websites and testing
frameworks?

1. I have to keep my laptop up and running all the time.
2. Personal laptops/computes don't have enough RAM CPU power to entertain huge requests
3. Internet connections are not that good.
4. Security is also a very big problem when it comes to host services on local machine.
5. Everyone can easily access them through their personal laptops
For these reasons we use servers.

==================================================================================
SDLC:
1. BAs discuss the requirements with clients and develop the SRS(Software requirement
specification) documents
2. This document is then shared with Architects and QA Team leads.
3. Architects design the Software Requirement Documents(SRD) and QA leads start
planning the testing.
4. Once the SRDs are ready developers start working(coding) and start building the
application.
5. This is where the deployment life cycle starts.
    a) Once the application is developed  on local/personal computers or laptops by
    developers or architects to review their code for any type of mistake and after that,
    they push the code to the git or any other version control system. Once it is done,
    they request the dev ops or IT team to deploy the application to the development
    server(Dev) so that they are sure application still works outside their laptops.
    b) QA will request Dev ops IT team to deploy it to the QA server.
    c) If everything looks good and all the test cases are passed, QAs will deploy it to the
    Staging server. Staging servers, they are replica of production servers so that
    we can test the application in as possible as same environment as production.
    d) If test cases fail, QA will report them to Developer and whole cycle starts again
